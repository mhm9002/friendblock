# friendblock

This is a basic social website similar to twitter. Orginally created on thenewboston Roberts Buckys' social network repository.

To have it working you need to;
   1) setup the database (import includes\db.sql).
   2) rename includes\config.1.php to config.php and fix all definitions (after obtaining google/facebook app id(s), pusher and recaptcha codes)
   3) rename v0.2\js\social.1.js to social.js
   
   and then it should be working. Recommended local hosting software "xampp"
